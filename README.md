## Welcome to the Articles Manage App. 
###### Version 1.0

This is a ***Spring-Boot MongoDB React*** project. With this application we try to handle the creation, update, and manage articles. Articles will be created, updated, and erased in a esay way.

### Technologies used
| Tecnology | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Spring Boot | for building our backend |
| Mongo DB | to store our articles in a database |
| React | to build our frontend |


#### Spring Boot ![RM-Banner](/assets/springboot.png "Spring Boot")
* The **project structure** was made using [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/).
* We use Spring Boot to build our API backend, and this project include these dependencies:
    * Spring Web
    * Spring Data MongoDB
    * Lombok

* It also contains the entity **Article**
* This Backend also contains a ***unit test*** module.

#### MongoDB ![RM-Banner](/assets/mongo.png "MongoDB")
We use MongoDB as a `No relational database model` to store data
* This is how look our ***art_mongodb*** Mongo database:

#### React ![RM-Banner](/assets/ReactNoback.png "React")
We installed or updated *nodejs* to create our React module for our Front:
```sh
npm install npm -g 
cd main directory
npx create-react-app rm-frontend
```
We also installed `react-roter-dom` for manage routes and more:
```sh
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
We worked with `axios` for doing http requests:
```sh
npm install --save axios
```
We also installed `react-hook-form` for manage and validate forms:
```sh
npm install react-hook-form
```
We used `SweetAlert2` for alerts:
```sh
npm install --save sweetalert2
```
And `Moment` for formatting dates:
```sh
npm install --save moment react-moment
```
### What we learned?
> Related with the back-end:
>> Go deeper with Spring Boot framework.
>> Better experience working with No SQL database (MongoDB). 
>> How to configurate and work with uploading images.
>> Allow connection to the front-end.

> Related with the front-end:
>> A great experience using React.
>> Using libraries like: SweetAlert2, Moment, Axios, and react-router-dom.
>> Implementing process to interact with the backend.

> Complete a full stack Java application.

> Good introduce to [Kanban Board](https://draft.io/9ebrxbyz5e4buxhxtsp4rwvh8by94xuvs692ahzqwugq "Kanban")
